## 🆚 Detection Methods Comparison

### 📸 OpenCV (HSV Color Masking)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Lightweight and fast** – Ideal for real-time applications on low-resource systems.
- ✅ **Easy to implement** – Requires minimal setup and no training phase.
- ✅ **Simple integration with ROS 2** – Works directly with camera image topics.
- ✅ **No internet/model dependencies** – Fully offline method.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Highly sensitive to lighting** – Varying illumination or shadows can affect detection accuracy.
- ❌ **Only detects based on color** – Cannot differentiate between objects of the same color.
- ❌ **Not scalable** – Needs separate tuning for each new object or color.
- ❌ **Prone to false positives** – May detect unrelated orange-colored items.

### 🧠 YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once – Deep Learning)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **High accuracy and robustness** – Detects objects even in challenging lighting or partial occlusion.
- ✅ **Supports multiple object classes** – Not limited to color; recognizes object shapes.
- ✅ **Custom training possible** – Can be fine-tuned for detecting cones, boxes, etc.
- ✅ **Less prone to false detections** – Learns detailed visual features.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Heavier and slower on CPU** – Real-time performance requires a GPU for smooth operation.
- ❌ **Initial setup is complex** – Needs model loading, dependencies, and possibly training.
- ❌ **Requires labeled training data** – For objects not already in YOLO’s pretrained classes.
- ❌ **More dependencies** – PyTorch, torchvision, and sometimes internet access for model download.

### 📝 Final Note

Both methods were tested for detecting an orange cone in a Gazebo environment using a camera plugin. While OpenCV gave fast results with minimal setup, YOLO provided more accurate and reliable detection, especially under varied lighting and background conditions.
