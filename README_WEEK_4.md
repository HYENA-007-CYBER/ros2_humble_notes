# Detection Methods Comparison: OpenCV vs YOLOv5

This section compares two different object detection approaches used for detecting an orange cone in a Gazebo simulation via ROS 2 and camera plugin.

## OpenCV (HSV Color Masking)

OpenCV's method for detection is based on segmenting the image by color using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) thresholding. This is one of the most basic but commonly used approaches for color-based object detection.

### How It Works
- The input image is converted from BGR to HSV color space.
- A color range for orange is defined using lower and upper HSV bounds.
- A binary mask is created to filter out all colors except the defined orange.
- Contours are detected on this mask to locate the object.

### Advantages

- **Fast and Lightweight**  
  OpenCV runs efficiently even on low-end CPUs. Detection is almost instantaneous with minimal computational resources.

- **Simple to Set Up**  
  Requires no training, no deep learning frameworks, and no internet access. Just define color ranges and apply contour detection.

- **Customizable Color Range**  
  Users can tweak the HSV bounds to target different shades of orange (e.g., lighter or darker orange depending on the Gazebo material).

- **Ideal for Fixed Conditions**  
  In environments with stable lighting and minimal visual clutter, OpenCV offers good performance for single-color object detection.

### Limitations

- **No Understanding of Shape or Context**  
  OpenCV cannot differentiate between an orange cone and any other orange object. It detects purely based on color.

- **Color Sensitivity**  
  Although not faced in this project, varying lighting conditions can alter perceived HSV values, reducing reliability.

- **Not Scalable**  
  If the object color changes or if multiple object types are to be detected, each new case must be manually tuned.

- **High Risk of False Positives**  
  Background objects, world textures, or lighting artifacts with similar orange shades can trigger incorrect detections.

## YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once – Deep Learning)

YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection framework that uses deep learning to detect and classify objects in images. It operates on learned visual features rather than raw color.

### How It Works
- A pretrained model (like yolov5s) is loaded using PyTorch.
- The input image is processed by the neural network to identify object boundaries and their class labels.
- The model uses feature hierarchies to distinguish between objects even with shape deformation or background clutter.

### Advantages

- **Understands Object Shape and Structure**  
  YOLO doesn't rely on color. It can detect cones even when partially occluded or under different lighting.

- **Robust to Environmental Noise**  
  Performs well even in presence of shadows, variable lighting, or textured backgrounds.

- **Supports Multi-Class Detection**  
  YOLO can detect multiple objects (cones, pedestrians, boxes) in one pass.

- **Custom Training Capability**  
  If a specific object (like a custom orange cone) isn't detected, the model can be retrained on a labeled dataset with new images.

### Limitations

- **Heavier Computational Load**  
  Without GPU acceleration, YOLOv5 performs slowly. In this project, the system had only a CPU, which led to reduced frame rates.

- **Complex Setup**  
  Requires PyTorch, Torchvision, and various other dependencies. Some packages like seaborn and gitpython had to be manually installed.

- **Needs Model Downloads**  
  Pretrained weights (e.g., yolov5s.pt) are downloaded over the internet and cached.

- **Requires Data for Custom Classes**  
  If the orange cone is not part of YOLO’s default class set, a labeled dataset is necessary for training, which increases project scope.

## Final Notes

In this project, OpenCV was easy to implement and worked well due to consistent lighting and the use of a single, distinct color (orange). However, it lacked robustness and could not scale to more complex scenarios.

YOLOv5 offered a more accurate and generalizable detection pipeline, capable of distinguishing objects by shape, texture, and context, but required significantly more setup time, system resources, and knowledge of deep learning workflows.

The selection of method depends on project scope:
- Use **OpenCV** for quick, color-based prototyping in controlled environments.
- Use **YOLOv5** when robustness, multiple object detection, and real-world deployment are priorities.
